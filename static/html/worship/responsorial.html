				Let all your works give you thanks, O Lord, <br />
				and let your faithful ones bless you.<br />
				Let them discourse of the glory of your kingdom<br />
				and speak of your might.
				<br /><br />
				<strong>I will praise your name for ever, my king and my God.</strong>
				<br /><br />
				The Lord is faithful in all his words <br />
				and holy in all his works.  <br />
				The Lord lifts up all who are falling <br />
				and raises up all who are bowed down.
				<br /><br />
				<strong>I will praise your name for ever, my king and my God.</strong>
