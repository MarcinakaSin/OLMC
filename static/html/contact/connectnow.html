				<h4><u>ParishSoft Church Software</u></h4>
				<p>
					Our Lady, Mother of the Church (OLMC) is using ParishSoft church software to maintain accurate parishioner and sacramental records.  This software keeps track of every family, member, and sacramental detail.
				</p>
				<h4><u>Register Now !!</u></h4>
				<p>
					It is important that each family review and update its information.  Registration is now open for on-line access to the parish family database.  It’s secure, paperless, and convenient for all parish members. To register, visit the website:  <a href="https://connectnow.parishsoft.com/Chicago" target="_new">https://connectnow.parishsoft.com/Chicago</a>.  
				</p>
				<h4><u>ConnectNow Family Directory</u></h4>
				<p>
					The ConnectNow Family Directory delivers a fresh, modern and intuitive interface and is accessible from any device with an Internet connection.
					<br /><br />
					Our Lady, Mother of the Church (OLMC) accepts online updates and registrations. Members who are already registered can log in and update their own family’s contact information or add photos through the My Own Church portal.  New members can register online, too, and all submissions, once approved by OLMC’s staff, flow directly into the main parish database.  That means all staff have the most up-to-date records available at any given time for religious education, ministry, pastoral care, reporting, and communications. 
					<br /><br />
					If the pastor needs to head out after-hours to see someone who is sick or in crisis, he can count on the parishioner profile in his ConnectNow mobile app to be correct.  Parishioner’s use of the My Own Church portal will improve the accuracy of addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Of course, the office will always welcome updates from walk-ins, phone calls, and paper documents.  
					<br /><br />
					The goal is accurate census and contact information. And the information is crucial to helping the parish communicate better with members, provide pastoral care, and save on mailing costs.  A more complete email database will allow OLMC to take advantage of the software’s built-in email capability, which is still the most efficient and cost-effective way to keep parish groups and individual members in-the-know.
				</p>
				<h4><u>Ministry Scheduler</u></h4>
				<p>
					In addition, one of the modules in the ConnectNow software is the Ministry Scheduler.  There you can edit your preferences such as which Mass you most prefer to serve at, you can note whether you prefer to minister with other family members, and you can mark the days you are not available to serve.  In addition, there is a calendar with your scheduled ministry.
