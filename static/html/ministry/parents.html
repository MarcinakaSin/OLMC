				<h3 class="text-center"><strong>Enabling Catholic Parents to be primary educators <br />
				of their children in the Faith</strong></h3>

				<h4>Mission Statement:</h4>
				<p>	
					To assist parents in their hope to establish the faith of their children by reflecting with them some real facts and circumstances and practical ways to practice the Catholic faith in their home.
					<br /><br />
					To strengthen and nourish the lived-experiences of parents as they discover their role in the faith formation of their children by building a strong moral and spiritual foundation.
					<br /><br />
					To increase knowledge of religious fundamentals and inspire the growth of sacramental awareness.
					<br /><br />
					To deepen the relationship between parents and children in their relationship with one another and with God.
				</p>
				<h4>Faith Formation of Parents:</h4>
				<p>
					The parish of Our Lady, Mother of the Church views parent’s faith formation as a personal spiritual development that allows each parent to encounter their children with dignity, integrity, compassion and love through the examples of Christ Jesus. The Faith Formation program exists to assist parents in their responsibility of forming their children in the Catholic faith into which they have been baptized.
				</p>
				<p class="text-center">
					<strong>“Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their children<br />
					in the faith, prayer, and all virtues. They have the duty to<br />
					provide as far as possible for the physical and<br />
					spiritual needs of their children.”</strong><br />
					Catechism of the Catholic Church, 543, 2252
				</p>
				<p>
					Every parent, whether their children attend the RE program or not, is encouraged to attend the parent’s faith formation. While the children are learning the faith, the parents also discern and reflect their role as primary educators of their children in the faith.
				</p>
				<h4>Schedule:</h4>
				<p>
					Sessions will begin in September 26, 2015, Saturday at 10:00 AM. Meetings will be held every 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Saturday of each month.
					<br /><br />
					If you have further inquiries about the parent’s faith formation program, please contact Dr. Glenn Bisquera at 773.625.2273 or email at <a href="mailto:dre.olmc@gmail.com?subject=Our Lady Mother Church - Parents Ministry" target="_new">dre.olmc@gmail.com</a>.
